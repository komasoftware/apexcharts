# apexcharts

This is a mirror of [apexcharts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/apexcharts), bundled and exposed as ES module.

## Install

```
npm install @komasoftware/apexcharts
bower install komasoftware/apexcharts
```

## Use

```html
<script type="module">
  // from main file
  import { apexcharts } from 'apexcharts';
